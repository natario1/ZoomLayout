ZoomLayout was developed by Mattia Iavarone ([contact me!](contact)) and is maintained with precious 
help from [Markus Ressel](https://github.com/markusressel). If you like the project, use it with profit, 
or simply want to thank back, please consider [supporting it](https://github.com/natario1/ZoomLayout/issues/125)!

As the original developer, I offer private support hours through the GitHub Sponsors program and 
I'm open to help your company with features that are not currently supported by the open source project.

Thank you!
